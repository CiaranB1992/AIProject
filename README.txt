Additional features:
1.Bomb powerup enables the user to move through walls for a certain ammount of steps
2.A golden block spawns at least 200 units away from the player which MUST be obtained before 
proceeding to the exit (white block = exit)
3. Made my own path finding algorithms for my enemies. One of which is a random walk varient,
the other which i did not implement due to errors was a search and destroy algorithm
whereby the enemies will always move towards your position

I couldn't get the enemies fully threaded and moving based on a timer/delay function so I 
improvised by making the enemies move independantly of each other whenever the player moves.

When the game is completed or the player dies the program exits and a message appears in
the eclipse console.

The Jar file had compiling errors but i included one which appears to be broken, at least
on my eclipse. The program runs fine from within eclipse
but I am speculating that my eclipse needs updating in order for jars to work
 and am working on it. If I get the jar file running i will upload it. 
The Jar file is in the lib folder but will not run on my pc. 
The broken Jar file is called MazeGame.jar

The game is run by using the GameRunner class after downloading my entire project from github
